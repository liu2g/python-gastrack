# Gas Tracking Prediction in Python
A project that aims to track and predict gas prices in USA. Detail see [my blog post](https://liu2z2.github.io/articles/20200429-developing-a-gas-price-tracking-and-prediction-application/).

## Work in Progress
As stated in my blog post, after the web crawler part is finished, the prediction is yet to implement.
